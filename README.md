# AdventCoding
Every day a new piece of code is aimed to be uploaded
The code will most often be in python
The aim is to use previous days projects later on in the month to produce something better

Day 1 - 'Vector.py':<br>
    -A vector class<br>
    -Operates in 2D<br>
    -Allows for basic vector creation and manipulation<br>
Day 2 - 'Entity.py':<br>
    -An object that implements simplistic physics<br>
    -Uses the turtle module to display entities in the module<br>
    -Just click anywhere on the produced screen and a dot will appear with physics<br>
    -Implements the Vector class from Day 1<br>
Day 3 - 'Object.py':<br>
    -This file contains both a polygon type and mesh type<br>
    -Will be used and extended on a later day for use in another project<br>
Day 4 - 'Button.py':<br>
    -An object that defines a button<br>
    -It requires a top left corner origin, a size and an outlet function in order to work<br>
    -Uses turtle and the Vector class from Day 1<br>
Day 5 - 'Fractals.py':<br>
    -Creates a sierpinski triangle<br>
    -It randomly chosses between 3 seed points, moves halfway there, places a dot and repeats<br>
    -Uses python's turtle module<br>
Day 6 - 'PiEstimator.py':<br>
    -Estimates pi using randomly generated positions<br>
    -Uses an Updated Vector class from Day 1 that returns a sqaured magnitude<br>
Day 7 - 'SumOf.py':<br>
    -An object that can calculate the sum of a formula with a start point and end point<br>
    -The formula is defined as a lambda in python<br>
    -Emulates sigma notation as arguments in a class instance<br>
Day 8 - 'Grapher.py':<br>
    -An object that create a graph with a defined x and y scale using python's turtle<br>
    -Grid lines(dividers) can be defined with a seperate x and y value<br>
    -Allows plotting of a plot on the axis<br>
Day 9 - 'Plotter.py':<br>
    -Used in conjunction with Grapher.py from day 8<br>
    -Creates a list of points between an x range, stepping through this range with a step rate<br>
    -It returns a list of vectors (Day 1) that contain an x and y to plot<br>
    -Updated Grapher.py from day 8 to take a Plotter and plot all points from it<br>
Day 10 - 'MouseTracer.py':<br>
    -A program that traces the mouse with dots on a turtle window<br>
    -Uses the turtle module to trace the mouse<br>
Day 11 - 'Boid.py':<br>
    -An object that emulates flocking<br>
    -Project will extend multiple days. On day 12, steering behaviours began to be implemented<br>
    -Depends on turtle and Vector from Day 1<br>
Day 12 - 'Tree.py':<br>
    -An object that will place a tree on a turtle window<br>
    -Has a customisable component size and position<br>
    -Uses python's turtle<br>
Day 13 - 'EulersConstant.py':<br>
    -Calculates eulers constant using no external library<br>
    -Uses a custom non recursive factorial function to bypass recursive limit<br>
Day 14 - 'Hangman.py':<br>
    -Runs a text based hangman game<br>
    -Asks for a target word and accepts input for approach to the target word<br>
