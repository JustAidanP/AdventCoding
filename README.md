# ChristmasCoding
Every day a new piece of code is aimed to be uploaded
The code will most often be in python
The aim is to use previous days projects later on in the month to produce something better

Day 1 - 'Vector.py':<br>
    -A vector class<br>
    -Operates in 2D<br>
    -Allows for basic vector creation and manipulation<br>
Day 2 - 'Entity.py':<br>
    -An object that implements simplistic physics<br>
    -Uses the turtle module to display entities in the module<br>
    -Just click anywhere on the produced screen and a dot will appear with physics<br>
    -Implements the Vector class from Day 1<br>
Day 3 - 'Object.py':<br>
    -This file contains both a polygon type and mesh type<br>
    -Will be used and extended on a later day for use in another project<br>
Day 4 - 'Button.py':<br>
    -An object that defines a button<br>
    -It requires a top left corner origin, a size and an outlet function in order to work<br>
    -Uses turtle and the Vector class from Day 1<br>
